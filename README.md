Bruno is a new and innovative API client, aimed at revolutionizing the status quo represented by Postman and similar tools out there.

Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language, Bru, to save information about API requests.

You can use git or any version control of your choice to collaborate over your api collections.

## General issues

1. CMD+W closes the current tab in Postman... closes the whole app in Bruno without prompting to save any unsaved work.

## Explorations
